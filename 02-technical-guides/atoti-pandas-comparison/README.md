# Atoti pandas Comparison

Run a performance comparison between Atoti and pandas.

The following notebooks perform a side-by-side comparison of a VaR use case in which VaR and ES are calculated at 95% and 99% confidence intervals for three different granularities: top-of-house (global value for entire financial institution), combination of book and trade, and combination of all attributes.

Response times and memory usage are analyzed.

1. [main.ipynb](main.ipynb): Run the VaR use case in Atoti.
2. [pandas-main.ipynb](pandas-main.ipynb): Run the VaR use case in pandas.
