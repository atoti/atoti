## Data Analytics in Python Notebooks

This course has been designed for new users to get started with Atoti Python SDK.  
It will show you how to build a cube with custom measures and start analyzing data to explore and draw meaningful insights.

You can follow and complete at your own speed using the downloadable Atoti software which youâ€™ll install on your own machines. 
The tutorial usually takes around 5 hours to complete.

You will learn how to:
- Deploy Atoti using Python in your own environment
- Understand the basic concepts involved in building an Atoti cube
- Customize a cube
- Use the cube to explain and present data

The course is in two parts:
- [Part 1: Introduction to Atoti Python Notebook](./introduction-to-atoti/main.ipynb)
- [Part 2: Using Atoti for Storytelling](./storytelling-with-atoti)
